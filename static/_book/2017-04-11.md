# Getting data in via ProjectTemplate

First, here is a draft of the R header chunk that I will want to include in every post that uses R (silently):


```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '', cache = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "..")
```
I'm sure I'll come up with some more.

Now, on to how to load the Arabidopsis data using ProjectTemplate. I started with the Ler population data, which is in multiple xlsx files, with one sheet having data, one having metadata, and potentially some blank sheets as well. If I follow the standard protocol for ProjectTemplate and drop them into the `data` directory, then when I execute `load.project()` I get a data object for every sheet of every file (because there is no way to pass options to `read.xlsx()`. In addition, now that they are loaded as data objects, it is hard to access them in a loop to build a the combined datasets. Finally, the workspace is cluttered with all of these objects; if I delete them as part of the data munging, then they will get reloaded the next time I use `load.project()`, which is time consuming!

So instead I took the data files out of the project directory, and used the option to have a `.R` file in the `data` directory. Using this, I can re-use my existing code to read the files in from the Dropbox directory and manipulate them as I want, deleting the intermediate objects and just keeping the final objects. Furthermore, if I then cache the objects, then subsequent loads are fast!

So here's the file:

```r
cat(readLines('data/popLer.R'), sep = '\n')
```

```
### Creates the data objects popLer and popLer_cm, representing the Ler populations
###     experiments

# Raw data consists of one file per generation
# Final column is named inconsistently, so needs to be corrected before merge

data_dir <- "~/Documents/Dropbox/Arabidopsis/Data/Exp1"
data_fname <- list.files(data_dir, "seedposition")

popLer_cm <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(data_fname)) {
  tempdata <- xlsx::read.xlsx(file.path(data_dir, data_fname[i]), sheetName = "Data", 
                              header = TRUE)
  names(tempdata)[9] <- "seedlings"
  popLer_cm <- rbind(popLer_cm, tempdata)
  rm(tempdata)
}

# Clean up column names and get a useful order
popLer_cm <- popLer_cm[-1]
names(popLer_cm) <- c("ID", "Treatment", "Rep", "Gap", "Generation", "Pot", "Distance",
                      "Seedlings")
ord <- with(popLer_cm, order(Treatment, Gap, Rep, Generation, Pot, Distance))
popLer_cm <- popLer_cm[ord,]

# Make a version that just has pot totals
require(plyr)
popLer <- ddply(popLer_cm, .(ID, Gap, Rep, Treatment, Generation, Pot), summarize,
                Seedlings = sum(Seedlings))
ord <- with(popLer, order(Treatment, Gap, Rep, Generation, Pot))
popLer <- popLer[ord,]
```


Now let's look at what we get:

```

Looking good!

This has the added advantage that any changes in the data that Jenn makes can be easily loaded by deleting the cache; and that I can share the project on a public github directory (and Jenn can use it as long as we have our Dropbox in the same place).
