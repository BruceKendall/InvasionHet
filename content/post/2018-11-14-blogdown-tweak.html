<p>I’ve modified <code>themes/hugo-lithium-theme/archetypes/default.md</code> to include the <code>setup2</code> chunk. Thus that chunk gets automatically added into a new blog post created with the addin. This goes into all new posts, so will need to be deleted in md files. I made a second archetype that was a copy of the original, but it doesn’t seem to be available from the addin menu.</p>
<p>Looking into this, it seems like it <em>should</em> be available; I’ve posted a question on stackexchange.</p>
