Here are the goals of this project, as I see them currently:

1. Understand how variation in spread rate is affected by demographic and environmental stochasticity affecting demography; finite draws and kernel sampling affecting dispersal; and genetically driven heterogeneity in mean demography and dispersal.
2. Understand how these contributions change as habitat becomes more fragmented.
3. Understand how drift and selection lead to increases or decreases in spread variability.
