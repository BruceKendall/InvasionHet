<p>Note that the optional parameter <code>truncated</code> can be passed through via the dots. The truncated case needs to be written (the function in fitdistcens will be different).</p>
<p>Note that there are comments in the code that are not coming through here—somehow the rmarkdown rendering is “tidying” the code output!</p>

<div id="exponential-power" class="section level2">
<h2>Exponential power</h2>
<p>This is another name for the generalized normal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution</a>) and has been implemented in package <strong>gnorm</strong> (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gnorm/vignettes/gnormUse.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gnorm/vignettes/gnormUse.html</a>). It’s a three-parameter distribution with the normal, Laplace and uniform distributions as special cases. It’s defined on the whole real line, so I could either truncate it (allowing the mode to be either positive or negative) or make a “half-gnorm,” setting the location parameter (mu) at zero and reflecting the distribution.</p>
<p>Getting start values for the parameters is non-trivial (the Gamma function would need to be inverted!), but a decent starting place in either case would be <code>beta = 2</code>, which gives the normnal distribution; in that case the <code>sigma</code> of the normal distribution is equivalent to <code>sqrt(2) * alpha</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="half-normal" class="section level2">
<h2>Half-normal</h2>
<p>So let’s look at half-distributions (which will also be needed for 2Dt). Here’s what I think it would look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dhnorm &lt;- function(x, sigma = 1, log = FALSE) {
  (x &gt; 0) * 2 * dnorm(x, 0, sigma, log)
}
phnorm &lt;- function(q, sigma = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE) {
  phn &lt;- (q &gt; 0) * (1 - 2 * pnorm(q, 0, sigma, lower.tail = FALSE))
  if (!lower.tail) phn &lt;- (q &gt; 0) * (1 - phn)
  if (log.p) phn &lt;- log(phn)
  phn
}
xx &lt;- seq(-1, 6, 0.1)
plot(xx, dhnorm(xx), type = &quot;l&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><img src="/InvasionHet/post/2018-11-20-more-on-distributions_files/figure-html/hnorm-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I’ve put the above functions in <code>dists.R</code> and added the distribution to <code>start_params()</code></p>
</div>
<div id="dt-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>2dt distribution</h2>
<p>The formula for the density function of the 2dt distribution given by Nathan et al. (2012) is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; a,b) = \frac{b-1}{\pi a^2}\left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)^{-b}.
\]</span>
Bullock et al (2017) claim to be using Nathan’s formulations but omit the final exponent (although there’s no way of knowing whether that’s a typo in the table, as they don’t appear to provide their code):
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; a,b) = \frac{b-1}{\pi a^2}\left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{a^2}\right).
\]</span>
Clark’s (1999) original formula is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; u,p) = \frac{p}{\pi u} \left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{u}\right)^{-(p+1)}.
\]</span>
This is equivalent to the Nathan formulation if we let <span class="math inline">\(b = p+1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a = \sqrt{u}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Nathan formula is for what he calls <span class="math inline">\(k_L(r)\)</span>, the “location kernel.” In 2-d space (the primary focus of the paper), this will be quite different from the “distance kernel” (<span class="math inline">\(k_D(r)\)</span>) because of the increasing area at each distance. However, in one dimension with bi-directional dispersal <span class="math inline">\(k_D(r) = 2k_L(r)\)</span>, and in fact we are measuring half of that, or <span class="math inline">\(k_L(r)\)</span>. But there are factors of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and 2 that look suspicious.</p>
<p>Let’s compare Nelson’s formulations with the theoretical ones for some standard distribution. We’ll start with the exponential, which in the theoretical case is only has non-negative support. The theoretical distribution is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}.
\]</span>
Nathan’s formulation is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; a) = \frac{1}{2\pi a^2} e^{-x/a}.
\]</span>
From the term in the exponential we get <span class="math inline">\(a = 1/\lambda\)</span>; but then there is an extra <span class="math inline">\(1/2\pi a\)</span> in Norman’s normalization constant. This is different from Nathan’s claimed conversion from <span class="math inline">\(k_L(r)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k_D(r)\)</span> in the 2D case, which is a factor of <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi x\)</span> (although note that the distributions are formulated such that <span class="math inline">\(a = E[x]\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the normal distribution, which has support on the full real line (as would 2Dt, as it has terms only in <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>). The theoretical distribution is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}.
\]</span>
The half-normal is thus, for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 0\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; \sigma) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2}}.
\]</span>
Nathan’s formula is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; a) = \frac{1}{\pi a^2} e^{-\frac{x^2}{a^2}}.
\]</span>
From the term in the exponential, we get that <span class="math inline">\(a = \sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}\)</span>, and thus the normalization term is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \frac{1}{\pi a} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \frac{1}{2 \pi a}\)</span>. So once again we have to multiply Nelson’s form by <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi a\)</span> to get the distribution we want.</p>
<p>This means that the distribution function we want for the 2Dt is
<span class="math display">\[
f(x; a,b) = \frac{2(b-1)}{a}\left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)^{-b},
\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there does not seem to be a straightforward analytical solution to the integral of this, for calculating the CDF, which is need by <code>fitdist</code> (the p form of the distribution). I could make a version with numerical integration; the question is, what sort of vectorization (if any) is required by fitdist? In fact, the built-in distribution functions seem to have rather unpredictable responses if vectors are provided for both x (or q) and one or more parameters. A quick google did not pull up any description; and since they use c code it’s not easy to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>The numerical integration is not vectorized, I think. Furthermore, the function to be used by optim is supposed to return a scalar result, so I think that we don’t need to worry about vectorization over parameters. But there may well be vectorization over x and q. I think the approach could be to write some draft functions and include warning statements that show the the dimensions of various inputs. That’s for tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Log-sech distribution</h2>
<p>A quick note that the log-sech distribution was one of the best. This wasn’t on my previous list. So need to look into that. I also think that I haven’t yet delved into the inverse power distribution.</p>
