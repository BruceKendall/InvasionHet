<p>I have updated and cleaned up <code>Ler_maxd_viz()</code> so that it shows violin plots for the simulations. In addition, the new simulations have a single MC replicate that has 10 replicate populations (mirroring the greenhouse); the mean and variance of spread is calculated among those 10 populations; and these stats collected across all of the MC replicates. Thus, we account for finite sample size (10 populations) in the empirical mean and variance.</p>

<p>It appears that, on my laptop at least, “Build website” doesn’t actually process new Rmd files. Thus, I need to knit the individual post by hand.</p>
