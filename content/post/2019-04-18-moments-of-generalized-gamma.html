<p>The fact that we are still having trouble fitting the generalized gamma suggests that we should move to a method of moments. Because the distribution has three parameters we need three moments. Wikipedia gives the mean and variance, but not the skew; and anywy it may be easier to use raw moments.</p>
<p>Stacy and Mihram (1965: Technometrics 7, 349-58) give an expression for the raw moments:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(X^r) = \frac{a^r \Gamma \left[\nu + r/p \right]}{\Gamma(\nu)}.
\]</span> This is only finite if <span class="math inline">\(r/p &gt; -\nu\)</span>.</p>
<p>This uses the original parameterization that the flexsurv authors do not like; the density function is: <span class="math display">\[
|p| x^{p \nu - 1} \frac{\exp \left[-(x/a)^p\right]}{a^{p \nu} \Gamma(\nu)}.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is close to the paramterization in gengamma.orig from flexsurv: their <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (“shape”, positive) is the positive half of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>; their <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>; their <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (“scale”, positive) is <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. So to get to the preferred parameterization we have…</p>
