Here is what I think will be an efficient way of putting the dispersed seeds in the right place. Let `relDseeds` be a $(2 D_{max}+1)\times n_{pots}$ matrix giving dispersal relative to the home pot (with row `Dmax + 1` being retention and rows above that being backwards dispersal). Then we can create an absolute dispersal matrix:
```r
# Lowest index of each column of relDseeds to include in Dseeds
lower <- pmax(1, Dmax - (1:npots) + 2) 

# Add an index row, available in the applied function as x[1]
relDseeds<-rbind(1:npots, relDseeds)

# Function to construct a column of Dseeds from a column of relDseeds
padCol <- function(x, lower, Dmax, npots) {
  leading_zeros <- rep(0, max(0, x[1] - Dmax - 1))
  dispersed_seeds <- x[-(1:lower[x[1]])]
  trailing_zeros <- rep(0, npots-x[1])
  c(leading_zeros, dispersed_seeds, trailing_zeros)
}

# Make a list of vectors for each column of Dseeds
Dseeds <- apply(relDseeds, 2, padCol, lower=lower, Dmax=Dmax, npots=npots)

# Convert the list to a matrix
Dseeds <- matrix(unlist(Dseeds), npots + Dmax, npots)
```
Finally, we can get the total number of seeds dispersed to each pot using apply:
```r
apply(Dseeds, 1, sum)
```
I think that, if `relDseeds` is actually the 3rd and 4th dimension of an array (with genotypes and reps being the first two), then we can `apply` all of the above to efficiently do this calculation for all g and r.
