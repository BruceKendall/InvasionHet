In trying to write up the data section of the TRACE document, I've realized that the TRACE section is really about data quality, not the actual parameterization. Furthermore, I'm having trouble keeping track of what I actually did. So I'm now writing a "Parameter estimation" document. For now I'm going to write a version that shows all the guts; we may want a cleaned up one (if at all) for publication.
