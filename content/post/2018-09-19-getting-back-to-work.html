<div id="blogdown" class="section level1">
<h1>Blogdown</h1>
<p>My last post from 9 months ago said that blogdown wasn’t working properly. I’m not sure if that’s still true, but my version of R at home is rather old, so I just updated to 3.5.1.</p>
<p>This requires reinstalling libraries, which is probably a good idea as there are a number of helper libraries that need to be rebuilt even when they don’t have an update (and hence can’t get reinstalled automatically):</p>
<ul>
<li>knitr (and dependencies)</li>
<li>rmarkdown (and dependencies)</li>
<li>ProjectTemplate</li>
<li>blogdown (and dependencies)</li>
<li>packages needed by serve.site() (downloaded automatically - thanks, Hadley!)</li>
<li>tidyverse</li>
<li>fitdistrplus</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, both <code>serve_site</code> and <code>build_site</code> seem to work just fine. But where is the <code>.Rprofile</code> file? There are two: one in content/post (the original one) and one in the project root (which I had added as a workaround). Let me take out the one in the project root and restart R to see if things still work…</p>
<p>Now it fails in the same way that it did before. It appears that the hyper-local .Rprofile is not read when rmarkdown processes the file. Putting the file back in the project root seems to do the trick.</p>

<div id="goals-and-plans" class="section level1">
<h1>Goals and plans</h1>
<p>I reviewed the original proposal to SNF, and wrote down, perhaps more clearly than before, a list of project goals (see separate post).</p>
<p>I also think it would be worthwhile to start generating a manuscript, using the proposal as the basis for the Introduction—it is quite well written!</p>
<p>And I do think that starting a TRACE document is a good way for me to figure out where I am in the project.</p>
