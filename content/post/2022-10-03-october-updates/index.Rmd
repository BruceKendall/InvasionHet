Here's where I'll keep a running tab of the incremental code updates and fixes

# Oct 3
## Fixed empty runway bug
I've fixed the error thrown when trying to evalueate the furthest occupied pot in an extinct replicate. This uses a new function, `last_occupied_pot()`, in `helpers.R`, which is called from within the model function but can also be called from the analysis code (see example usage in `make_Ler_sims.R`). The optional argument `zero` allows the return value for an empty replicate to be something other than zero (to avoid the risk of zero-index values).

I ran `make_Ler_sims` successfully, and the warnings indicated that it ran into 26 instances of an extinct replicate.
