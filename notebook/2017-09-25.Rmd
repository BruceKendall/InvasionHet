## Housekeeping
After repeated nagging from ProjectTemplate, I ran the script to update the project structure to v. 0.8. This changed the doc directory to docs, and added some new variables to global.dcf. Unfortunately the latter don't seem to be documented.... I'll also need to make sure that I update the package on my computer at home.
