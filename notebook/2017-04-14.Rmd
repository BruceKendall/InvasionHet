## Project setup
I have linked the project to a [github repository](https://github.com/BruceKendall/InvasionHet). I've excluded from the repository the .Rdata files in cache (which suggests that I should put the `cache()` commands in the file generating the data, otherwise I need to remember to do them by hand on a new computer) and the `notebook/_book` directory, which has files created when I build the notebook. I did retain `notebook/_bookdown_files`, as that is where the caches for the notebook pages are stored. This means that I am saving binary objects (e.g., .Rdata files), but they shouldn't get updated unless I modify code blocks in past journal entries.

The file `notebook/_main.rds` also needs to be ignored, as it is regenerated by bookdown each time. Unfortunately it has already been checked in; I need to figure out how to remove it. A quick google reveals that running `git rm --cached notebook/_main.rds` from the command line does the trick---and I've done it.

I'm now experimenting with a new format for the notebook where the "chapter" is the date and the days entries are a second level head. Let's see how that goes.

I've just checked on Jenn's package, and it looks like she is using Dropbox directly under her home directory (i.e., file paths read `~/Dropbox`). Right now my Dropbox folder is inside `~/Documents` (which I think might be the default setup for mac). I have just moved my Dropbox folder up a level (using preferences in the Dropbox app)---I hope that doesn't break anything else!
