      <description>Mark Lewis’s new book has a whole chapter on “stochastic spread:”
 Our focus is on the rate at which such processes spread spatially. We first examine the effects of environmental stochasticity on spatial spread by means of stochastic integrodifference and reaction–diffusion models. Here, we analyze both the wave solution for the expected density of individuals and the wave solution for a given realization of the stochastic process, as well as the variability that this can exhibit.</description>
