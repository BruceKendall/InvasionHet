      <description>Let’s think about which distributions could be good. We know what the (half-)normal, exponential, and log-normal look like.
Nathan et al. (2012) also suggest:
 Exponential power 2Dt Inverse power Logistic Mixture models Inverse Gaussian (Wald) Wiebull Gamma  The scaling factors in Nathan et al. are for two-dimensional dispersal expressed in radial distance (I think). They suggest that this can be converted to a “distance kernel” by multiplying by \(2\pi r\), but that doesn’t seem right for e.</description>

      <title>Directional dispersal in Ler</title>

      <description>The correlation between the fraction dispersing and the mean dispersal distance of the dispersers could be mean one of two things:
Simulated rain that makes more seeds go makes them go further in all directions Simulated rain that makes more seeds go is pushing them in the direction of the receiving runway  This matters because in case 2, the dispersal kernel in the negative direction will, presumably, have its absolute mean reduced.</description>

      <title>Ler kernel heterogeneity</title>

      <description>The next steps in the Ler dispersal analysis are to confirm statistical support for among-rep heterogeneity and see if the kernel parameters are correlated with the fraction dispersing.
Housekeeping Added the functions for the truncated distributions and to fit the models to lib/helpers.R.
 Kernel heterogeneity The total AIC for the rep-specific fits was 58230.28 and 58366.17 for the normal and lognormal models, respectively.
I think that if I pass the whole data set to the analysis function it will combine all the data.</description>

      <description>File to load Ler dispersal data Here is the new file data/disperseLer.R:
### Creates the data object disperseLer, representing the Ler dispersal experiment # Get data from Jenn&amp;#39;s file data_dir &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;~/Dropbox/Arabidopsis/analysis&amp;quot; disperseLer &amp;lt;- read.csv(file.path(data_dir, &amp;#39;2013_08_08_Exp1_Spray.csv&amp;#39;), header = TRUE) # Drop the &amp;quot;clipped&amp;quot; treatment disperseLer &amp;lt;- droplevels(subset(disperseLer, new_trt != &amp;quot;clipped&amp;quot;, drop = TRUE)) # Drop the columns with the (irrelevant) info about where the mom pots came from disperseLer &amp;lt;- disperseLer[, -c(1:4, 6)] # Clean up column names names(disperseLer) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;ID&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Distance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Seedlings&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Siliques&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Density&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Treatment&amp;quot;) # Make some factor variables disperseLer$ID &amp;lt;- as.</description>
