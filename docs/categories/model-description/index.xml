      <description>Focus on Ler? As I look at various pieces of the model (which I’ve started to assemble in lib/model.R), I realize that there are a sufficient number of ways in which the RIL data are different (and not yet analyzed) that I may find it challenging to exactly mirror the Ler model. In particular, I’m going to find it rather challenging (I think) to estimate the environmental stochasticity in seed production among generations and replicates.</description>

      <description>Conceptual overview The model has two fundamental steps:
Seed production Seed dispersal  Seed production is density dependent, with a Gompertz deterministic skeleton: \[\begin{equation} \log(S_{g,t,x}) = a_g + b_g \log(N_{g,t,x}), \end{equation}\] where \(S\) is seed number and \(N\) is adult number; \(g\) is genotype, \(t\) is generation and \(x\) is location. In addition, there is demographic stochasticity (probably Poisson, but need to check); temporal environmental stochasticity; and among-replicate environmental stochasticity. Need to check how well correlated the latter are among RILs.</description>
