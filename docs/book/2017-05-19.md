## Evolution data: Gen 7 = no

Jenn has this to say about generation 7 of the evolution experiment (email of 19 May):

> Gen7 was the mystery one... it had tons of contaminants in the genetic data, seedlings went weird distances (strangely far and/or not at all), and that’s when Sara was really having a ton of trouble. We didn’t include Gen7 in the Science paper because of all these potential challenges with it (although did analyze it to make sure the results didn’t all just go away!). So I think also better to leave it out of your analyses.

## Reboot Ler fecundity
Need to check if the data have changed!

### Generation 1 fecundity
(Update of original analysis of 21 April 2017)


```r
ggplot(Ler_seed_gen1, aes(x = eff_sd_no, fill = as.factor(Density))) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50)
```

<img src="2017-05-19_files/figure-html/sdlgHist1-1.png" width="672" />


```r
kable(group_by(Ler_seed_gen1, Density) %>% 
        summarise(Mean = mean(eff_sd_no), Variance = var(eff_sd_no)),
      caption = paste("Mean and variance across pots of effective seed number",
                      "in treatments B and C of Ler generation 1")
      )
```



Table: Mean and variance across pots of effective seed number in treatments B and C of Ler generation 1

 Density    Mean    Variance
--------  ------  ----------
       1   133.9    3443.433
      50   347.6   21362.933

This is identical to the original analysis.

### Time variation in fecundity
This is the part of the 24 April analysis that looked at treatment B:

```r
Ler3pBC <- filter(popLer, Gap == "3p", Treatment != "A")
Ler3pBC <- group_by(Ler3pBC, Treatment, Pot, Rep) %>%
  mutate(Adults = lag(Seedlings)) 
Ler3pBC <- within(Ler3pBC,
                  {
                    Adults[Treatment == "B" & !is.na(Adults)] <- 1
                    Adults[Pot == 0 & Generation == 1] <- 1
                    Adults[Treatment == "C" & Pot == 0 & Generation == 1] <- 50
                  })
```

```r
filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "B") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gen, y = Seedlings)) + xlab("Generation") + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) 
```

```
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
```

<img src="2017-05-19_files/figure-html/Btimeseries-1.png" width="672" />

By eye, this looks unchanged. Let's try a log scale:

```r
filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "B") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gen, y = Seedlings)) + xlab("Generation") + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

```
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
```

<img src="2017-05-19_files/figure-html/BtimeseriesLog-1.png" width="672" />

That looks to mostly skew things in the other direction. Perhaps a square root transform?

```r
filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "B") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gen, y = Seedlings)) + xlab("Generation") + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +
  scale_y_sqrt()
```

```
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
notch went outside hinges. Try setting notch=FALSE.
```

<img src="2017-05-19_files/figure-html/BtimeseriesSqrt-1.png" width="672" />

That's nice. Now let's do a linear model:

```r
summary(lm(sqrt(Seedlings) ~ Gen, data = filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "B")))
```

```

Call:
lm(formula = sqrt(Seedlings) ~ Gen, data = filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == 
    "B"))

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

```

It actually looks like it might be linear!

```r
summary(lm(sqrt(Seedlings) ~ Generation, data = filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "B")))
```

```

Call:
lm(formula = sqrt(Seedlings) ~ Generation, data = filter(Ler3pBC, 
    Treatment == "B"))

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

```

This definitely seems like a more parsimonious model. However, it's not clear how we should interpret it! Certainly it doesn't accord with fluctuating effects of season or insect outbreaks. It could be that the team got better at inducing dispersal... one thing to look at would be to see whether there is a similar trend in the other landscapes, or a trend in the number of seeds jumping the gap.

OK, back to the reboot:

### Density dependent fecundity
(also based on April 24)

```r
qplot(data=Ler3pBC, x = Adults, y = Seedlings/Adults, 
      colour = Gen, log = "xy") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```
Warning: Removed 14 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

```

```

Generation 6 looks really different.

It's a bit less pronounced if we leave out treatment B, but it's still there:

```r
qplot(data=filter(Ler3pBC, Treatment == "C"), x = Adults, y = Seedlings/Adults, 
      colour = Gen, log = "xy") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```
Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

```

```

<img src="2017-05-19_files/figure-html/LerDD-1.png" width="672" />

Is it just Gen 6, or is there still a linear trend in the intercept?

```r
m1 <- lm(log(Seedlings/Adults) ~ Adults + Gen, data = Ler3pBC)

Yeah, that pretty much eliminates it all.
