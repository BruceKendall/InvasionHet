<p>I have finished the parameter estimation report (sort of).
I decided not to reconstruct the complex set of analyses that went into calculating the RIL-specific Gompertz parameters in the runup to the <em>Science</em> paper (which didn’t get used).
This will probably have to be done if a version of this document goes into a manuscript submission, but I’m confident that the results won’t change and I should move on to running simulations and writing a paper.</p>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level1">
<h1>Next steps</h1>
<p>In the run-up to the Davis talk, I generated a bunch of simulation results for Ler, but crashed and burned on RIL.
In the attempt to get the RIL model working, I may have compromised the Ler model (I was trying to have one model for everything, I think).
So here’s what I need to do:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check that the model still runs as a single-genotype model</li>
<li>Evaluate whether I need to rerun Ler (did parameter estimates change? Did I run enough replicates?)</li>
<li>Evaluate whether I need to “validate” the Ler model against anything other than spread rate mean and variance</li>
<li>Ensure that the codes for running the models are in reproducible scripts, and that the model functions themselves are adequately documented</li>
<li>Get the multi-genotype models working</li>
<li>Run RILs with and without evolution</li>
<li>Run single-genotype model with mean RIL params to get a baseline for heterogeneity</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve checked a few things. For (1), there is still some debugging to do, as the run I just did eventually generated a -Inf value for <code>runway_end</code>.
For (2), yes, I need to re-run, as I’ve added a limit to the number of new pots, based on the description of the experiment.</p>
